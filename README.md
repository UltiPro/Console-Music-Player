# Console-Music-Player
Console Music Player created by Patryk 'UltiPro' WÃ³jtowicz using .NET C#.

Console application with all music and volume controls. In addition, there are implemented transitions through folders and disks, automatic playback of songs in the order of the list (in the case of the end of the list, starting it again), animations, refreshing tracks and files, error handling in the absence of folders or files while the program is running and last but not least remembering the last path and player volume. Important! Application is dedicated for Windows 10 only on CMD (not Powershell).
